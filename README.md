This repository presents a real-world architectural breakdown of how I approached designing and deploying a scalable, cost-efficient website for a small-to-mid scale business use case. The project reflects my role as a **Solutions Architect**, with decisions grounded in business requirements, traffic expectations, and operational budgets.

## Problem Statement

> "The ask was simple ‚Äî build a website. The solution needed to be anything but."

Most small businesses think a basic website is enough. But when you're designing with **scale**, **availability**, and **cost-awareness** in mind, the architecture becomes a strategic lever.

This case study answers:
- How do we design for now **and** for growth?
- When does shared hosting break down?
- What are your AWS-backed alternatives?
- How do you choose the right deployment option?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Options Explored

| Architecture         | Use Case                      | Scalability | Monthly Cost |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Shared Hosting       | Entry-level brand site        |  Low       | $2‚Äì10         |
| S3 + CloudFront      | Static, modern business site  |  Very High | <$1           |
| Lightsail + WordPress| Low-maintenance CMS setup     |  Medium    | $5‚Äì10         |
| Elastic Beanstalk    | Fully managed WP w/ scaling   |  High      | $30‚Äì50        |
| EC2 + RDS            | Full infrastructure control   |  High      | $20‚Äì60        |

Each option comes with an **architecture diagram**, a **cost analysis**, and a **justification memo** in the repo.

## Architecture Diagrams

All diagrams are in `/diagrams/` (both `.drawio` and `.png`):

- `s3-cloudfront.drawio` ‚Äì Static website on S3 + CDN
- `lightsail-wordpress.drawio` ‚Äì WordPress on Lightsail
- `beanstalk-arch.drawio` ‚Äì Auto-scaled infra using Beanstalk
- `ec2-rds.drawio` ‚Äì Custom setup using EC2, RDS, Load Balancer

---

## Highlights from the Case Study

- Emphasis on **asking the right discovery questions** before development begins
- Real-world example of how **bandwidth limitations** affect shared hosting
- Cost breakdowns for low-traffic vs scalable setups
- CDN and image optimization via **S3 + CloudFront**
- Tradeoffs between **managed vs manual infrastructure**
